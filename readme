Introducing: Browza

What is it?
    Browza will detect and use any browsers you have on your machine in selenium tests.

Why is it useful?
    Write a test one time, and run it on whatever platform/browser you want.

* Currently only working for Mac, with Safari, Firefox and Chrome. Updates coming soon.
